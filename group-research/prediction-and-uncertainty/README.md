## Group Research Assignment: Prediction and Uncertainty

### Start here
The resources below are starting points. Read and watch them carefully, and do additional research finding your own resources, too. Discuss them amongst yourself and make notes.
Discussion points should include, **but are not limited to**:
- **[A]** analogies/comparisons between divination and prediction
 - may also include historic background
- **[B]** collective <> individual
  - problematics of going from collective average to individual fate
- **[C]** statistic vs. algorithmic prediction
- **[D]** social physics


### Next
1. Present your research. Introduce your peers to the subject (10-15 minutes).
  - Illustrate concepts through your own explanations and example cases (the New Yorker article has some; add others, too).
  - Focus specifically on what you think the class needs to know to actively take part in the discussion.
2. facilitate a discussion:
  - develop (provocative) questions**\*** related to/inspired by the subject
  - what contextual information does the class need to respond?
  - discussion mode/starter (e.g. paper, partner brainstorm, mind map etc.)

**Please** arrange a meeting with me to catch up on your work (how about Thursday or Friday?)

**\***A good question is one that allows for multiple perspectives.
