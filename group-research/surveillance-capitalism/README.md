## Group Research Assignment: Surveillance Capitalism

> "*Science Finds--Industry Applies--Man Confirms.*""

(Motto of the 1933 Chicago World's Fair)


### Intro
[*The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power*](https://www.amazon.com/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1610395697) by [Shoshana Zuboff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff) was published this year (2019). It's incredibly well researched, much talked about, yet it's easy to read and gives plenty of material for us to discuss! ðŸŽ‰

### Guide
Read through the sources supplied below. Watch the Zuckerberg video **after** all of the Zuboff material. Discuss them amongst yourself and take notes.

Here is the way I approach a reading like this ahead of a discussion: I read and underline every possible **prompt** that I could pose to the class and also every **bold**, provocative statement or view of the author - such views are great to confront the class with to spark discussion.

Discussion points should include, **but are not limited to**:
- Translation from human experience to behavioral data?
- Customers, products or sources?
  - Would Zuboff agree with this [cartoon](https://thednetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/freefood.jpeg)?
- Parallels to industrial revolution and climate change.
- Is Surveillance Capitalism the same as Technology?
- Is technology inevitable?
  - Also consider this (and all other points) in a Chinese context.
- After Zuckerberg video (watch AFTER Zuboff):
  - Why would surveillance capitalism be a good thing? Why would it not?
  - Personalization & Service Improvements vs. Behavioral Data Surplus

### Next Monday
1. Present your research. Introduce your peers to the subject (10-15 minutes).
  - Illustrate concepts through your own explanations and the example cases.
  - Focus specifically on what you think the class needs to know to actively take part in the discussion.
2. facilitate a discussion:
  - develop (provocative) questions**\*** related to/inspired by the subject
  - what contextual information does the class need to respond?
  - discussion mode/starter (e.g. paper, partner brainstorm, mind map etc.)

**Please** arrange a meeting with me to catch up on your work (how about Friday?)

**\***A good question is one that allows for multiple perspectives.
