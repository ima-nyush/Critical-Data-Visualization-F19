## Group Research Assignment: Prediction and Uncertainty

### Start here
The resources below are starting points. Read and listen to them carefully, and do additional research finding your own resources, too. Discuss them amongst yourself and make notes.
Discussion points should include, **but are not limited to**:
- What is ethical use of data?
- Research / Profit
  - What is the role of research in a profit-oriented environment.
- Ethics in large scale / ethics in targeted context.
- The role of the developer in ethical software design.


### Next
1. Present your research. Introduce your peers to the subject (10-15 minutes).
  - Introduce the example cases to the class, assume they have not heard of them before.
  - Illustrate concepts through your own explanations and the example cases.
  - Focus specifically on what you think the class needs to know to actively take part in the discussion.
2. facilitate a discussion:
  - develop (provocative) questions**\*** related to/inspired by the subject
  - what contextual information does the class need to respond?
  - discussion mode/starter (e.g. paper, partner brainstorm, mind map etc.)

**Please** arrange a meeting with me to catch up on your work (how about Friday?)

**\***A good question is one that allows for multiple perspectives.
