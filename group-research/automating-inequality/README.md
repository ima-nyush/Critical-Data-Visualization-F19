(Quote taken from *Automating Inequality*)


### Intro
[*Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor*](https://www.amazon.com/Automating-Inequality-High-Tech-Profile-Police/dp/1250074312) by [Virginia Eubanks](https://virginia-eubanks.com/about/) was published last year (2018). It's incredibly well researched , much talked about it the discourse around data and automation and yet it's easy to read! ðŸŽ‰

### Guide
Read through the sources supplied below. Discuss them amongst yourself and takes notes. Discussion points should include, **but are not limited to**:
- Why is/isn't the "digital poorhouse" a fitting analogy?
- Are there similar problems in China
  - The class will read about the Chinese Social Score (but this is an open discussion!)
- How to the poor and the working class suffer from automation?
- Is there parallels to the CompStat system we learned about in Week 2?

### Next Monday
1. Present your research. Introduce your peers to the subject (10-15 minutes).
  - Introduce the example cases to the class, assume they have not heard of them before.
  - Illustrate concepts through your own explanations and the example cases.
  - Focus specifically on what you think the class needs to know to actively take part in the discussion.
2. facilitate a discussion:
  - develop (provocative) questions**\*** related to/inspired by the subject
  - what contextual information does the class need to respond?
  - discussion mode/starter (e.g. paper, partner brainstorm, mind map etc.)

**Please** arrange a meeting with me to catch up on your work (how about Friday?)

**\***A good question is one that allows for multiple perspectives.
