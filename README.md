#### Course Description
Data is at the heart of the increasing role technology has in our lives. Data collection and algorithmic processing are not only central to recent technical breakthroughs such as in AI and automation but have created new economic paradigms where data equals value and shape political approaches to power and control.

Decisions based on algorithms affect society at large whether it‚Äôs changing the way we transport and distribute goods, or influencing the things we buy, the news we read or even the people we date. The *world* that algorithms *see* is data. For the average person, however, data is seldom more than an abstract idea.

So what exactly is data? How is value extracted from it? And why should we care? How can we ethically balance the positive uses of data-driven systems with the threats they pose to discriminate and infringe basic human rights?
This class seeks to untangle some of these issues practically and theoretically.

\*J Drucker

#### Assignments:

Due this Wednesday (2019/09/04):
- Do this assignment first (strongly recommended)
-  We will spend 50% of our time in this course coding. Having a shared foundation for this is **extremely important**. I will always be there to support and assist you with problems you encounter. For now, please work your way through [Coding Foundation: Setup and Exercises](coding-foundation) and submit your work in the end.
- Here is a thorough, interactive ``basic-javascript`` tutorial if you want to brush up your skills: [Basic JavaScript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/). And [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) is Codecadey's version.

Due Monday (2019/09/09):
- Listen to two parts of **Reply All's 'The Crime Machine' Podcast**. This is both super entertaining AND relevant next class. You can listen to the podcast via
  - your browser ([Part 1](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/o2hx34), [Part 2](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8hwl7))
  - castbox ([Part 1](https://castbox.fm/episode/127-The-Crime-Machine%2C-Part-I-id4550-id177120350), [Part 2](https://castbox.fm/episode/128-The-Crime-Machine%2C-Part-II-id4550-id177120351))
  - spotify ([Part 1](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6uagdYENZ1HjiaeX7gbqIN), [Part 2](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ULMa8oh9nJWSv4PM9gPNh))
  - apple podcast ([Part 1](https://podcasts.apple.com/hk/podcast/127-the-crime-machine-part-i/id941907967?i=1000446958122), [Part 2](https://podcasts.apple.com/hk/podcast/128-the-crime-machine-part-ii/id941907967?i=1000446958123))
  - other services (search "Reply All Crime Machine")
- Read [**Critical Questions for Big Data**](readings/boyd_crawford_2012.pdf) by danah boyd and Kate Crawford. The linked version has some intentional notes that will help you. Please read the whole text despite below prompts being pointed at specific sections. There is no right or wrong, **what counts more than anything is your own opinion**. For each prompt, write no more than a short paragraph:
  - Introduction and Chapter 2
    - Why does Bowker say "'*Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea*'" ? (pp. 663)
  - Section 1 (pp. 665)
    - What could be meant by the quote "'*accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure*'"? Try draw parallels to the CompStat system from the Reply All Podcast.
  - Section 3 and 4 (pp. 668)
    - In which way is Twitter data limited?
  - Section 5 (pp. 671)
    - If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.
  - Section 6
    - No prompts here, but a very well written chapter that is relevant to everything we will be talking about this semester. Please enjoy.

- what to collect? anything, the more detail the better.
- don‚Äôt just decide on what general subject to collect, but make a plan for the actual measurements (think of Dear Data)
- you can use a notebook, or spreadsheet, or build you own Google Form that you open up every evening/now and then/hour/minute.
- set an alarm for measurements.

- Take this example by [Giorgia Lupi](http://giorgialupi.com/dear-data). Each shape is a group of other shapes with attributes that represent different asspects of the data. She describes her logic on the back of the postcard. Create your own such logic for your data, and group shapes with different attributes into svg group elements.

  - The final project is **a story that emerges from and is told alongside a dataset** (or several).
    - Inspiration can be found in the articles you collectively [gathered this week](https://github.com/leoneckert/cdv-fall19/wiki/Two-Data-Articles-(week-7)).
    - To tell the story you will have to become **deeply familiar with a dataset** that you choose (or create): not only with its **technical structure**, but also its **context**, its **origin**, the **information it does/does not carry**, the **insights** it provides and **controversies** it might fuel.
  - You will present the contextual research part of this project in a 5 minute **Work in Progress / Context Presentation** (using slides) in Week 10. You are expected to demonstrate your research abilities, not your technical expertise. *What is the story that you are telling?*
  - After that, as your final project (Week 14), you will create a multi-page website: your **Data Story**. It must include at least two interactive data visualizations as well as contextual information (mainly from your Work in Progress presentation).


- **The Plan**
  - **Pre-select datasets**
    - due this Wednesday
    - see this week's assignment section below.
  - **Commit to a dataset**
    - this will happen next Monday.
  - **Contextual Research**
    - presented in Week 10.
  - **Build of a web based Data Story**
    - presented in Week 14.

###### random question:
who has used Node before?

#### Assignments:

Due **this** Wednesday (2019/10/23):
- Take a deep dive into the datasets that you can find online.

  - Find some sources for datasets in our [Resource](https://github.com/leoneckert/cdv-fall19/tree/master/other/resources) page.
    - if you find other cool sources (both english and chinese), consider [submitting them to a collection](https://forms.gle/66oLcntJBgvC3sQaA) I have started üòä
  - Dedicate time to this research, find something that you feel connected to and inspired by --> you will spend about five weeks dealing with the subject you choose, pick something exciting.
  - keep your mind open to the possibility of collecting or scraping an interesting dataset - if this is something of interest to you, I will assist and advise you.

#### Course Overview and Learning Outcomes
The overarching goal of this class is for students to gain the tools and the comfort to think critically about the ways data is utilized in the ever growing technological landscape we are immersed in.
With this in mind, the class is split in two weekly sessions: a theoretical class and a practical lab.

The classes include lectures introducing contemporary theorists, artists, groups, and in-class discussions or exercises. Four themes guiding this exploration are ‚ÄúData, Information, Knowledge‚Äù, ‚ÄúData Bias‚Äù, ‚ÄúData Ethics‚Äù and ‚ÄúPower, Control, Access‚Äù.
In the weekly lab, students will learn the fundamentals of web-based data visualization using JavaScript. The purpose of this is to understand what data feels like through hands-on experimentation and what data says or doesn‚Äôt say by rendering the information it carries visually.

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- **map** actors, their roles and relations within a broader data infrastructure
- **identify** problematics of "datafication" and **generate** ideas for response
- **identify** various visions, values and cultures inherent to datasets
- **build** data visualizations for the web
- **build** their own datasets
- **make use** of data APIs and scraped data
- **visually** communicate information pertaining to a given dataset
- **critique** their own work and others' constructively
