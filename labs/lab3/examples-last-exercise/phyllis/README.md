The data I used in this assignment is "how many times I laugh every 2 hrs." I used a really stupid method to visualize all 6 data sets as you may see in my code... Data from the same day shares the same color. Ideally, the x-axis should represent time slots, y-axis should be how many times I laugh, so that I can see the trending in one day or compare the data from different days in the same time slot. I only managed to aline data from one day vertically, and cannot spread out data according to "time".
