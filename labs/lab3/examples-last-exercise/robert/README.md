#### Different circles in this web page visualize the notifications I received on my phone between 4pm-5pm on September 11th. The horizontal ordinates of the circles are twenty times of the minutes of a certain notification. Colors of circles stand for different types of information which will have a clear introduction on the web page.

#### Hope you will like it ðŸ˜ƒ
