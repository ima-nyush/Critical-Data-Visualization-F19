### Lab 6: assignment

Add to the website we have built in [Lab 6](..). At any given time, all the data points with the same `name` should be on display. Put buttons into place that let the viewer select the points of which name should be shown. Transition between the selections. When you are done, push to your repo and submit a link to [the class wiki](https://github.com/leoneckert/cdv-fall19/wiki/Coding-Exercise:-Update-Transition-(week7))


###### Hints
You will need to write a function similar to getStep that filters by name, not by step. Then you can create more functions inside `getData()`, one for each name. Bind these functions to 'click' events of buttons on the page. You can use `addEventListener` to do that. Below is a screenshot of what the result should roughly look like, but please be creative. You can also add more transitions (color, size, etc.).
