      <h2>One week of my life depicted in compliments</h2>
<br>
<p> Throughout the week I took notice and wrote down all of the compliments
people gave me and the compliments I gave them.
I wrote down the day, the person who gave me the compliment
(or to whom I gave the compliment), the compliment type
and the medium in which I received or gave the compliment.
Based on my data set I decided to categorize my compliments if 4 categories
- work, appearance, personality, and birthday related.
Explained on this cover page is the key to reading my collected data.
After this project I realized that I receive many more compliments than I give
(even after taking into account that my birthday was on Sunday, which explains the
huge amount of compiments I recieved then), which I have promised to myself to
change and start giving people more compliments.
