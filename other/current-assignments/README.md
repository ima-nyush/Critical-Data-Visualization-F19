    - Focus on the layout, all scrolling, paging, etc. that you envision for your final project, should be included.

<!-- ##### Due Monday (2019/11/11):
  - On Monday, November 11th, your **Data Story: Work in Progress Presentations** is due.
    - you picked a dataset, for next week, research thoroughly about its **context**, its **origin**, the **information it does/does not carry**, the **insights** it might provide and **controversies** it could fuel.
    - prepare a 4 minute presentation
      - take [this]((https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tf8uFBpV1EsGzS-fqMbOSfryAwuczf9w6FIsmHcwyT4/edit?usp=sharing)) as a guide (see also below gif)
      - if you plan to **not** use Google Slides, please let me know by Friday
      - share a link to your slides with me by 11/11 noon.
      - pro tip: avoid too much text on your slides, it really does make them less clear. slides do not need to speak for themselves but illustrate what you have to say.

- Prepare a short presentation about your project's subject for next classes:

    - 5 slides that can only contain images
    - 20 seconds per slide as you talk along explaining your interest and what you hope to make visible through your project
    - practice your text and its timing (email it to me by Sunday if that helps)

- Next week's Group Research Presentation:
  - Kennedy, Sarah & Thomas
  - find the resources for your group research [here](/group-research/automating-inequality). -->

<!-- ##### Due Wednesday (2019/10/23):
- Read carefully through the Lab, maybe multiple times.
